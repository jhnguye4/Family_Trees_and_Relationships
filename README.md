# Family_Trees_and_Relationships
CSC 316 Project 2: Family Trees and Relationships

## Learning Objective
With this project you will construct a representation of a family tree from listings of its nodes in preorder and postorder, then answer questions about relationships of pairs of individuals (nodes) in the tree. The objectives of the project are to:
* implement a general tree data structure and the tree ADT operations; and
* gain experience with recursion by writing a recursive procedure to construct the tree from its
preorder and postorder traversals.

## Specifications
Your task is to develop and implement a recursive procedure to construct the tree from its preorder and postorder traversals. Write all your code in terms of the tree ADT operations For this project, you may not use built-in Java classes, you need to implement your own classes. Choose an appropriate implementation for this application from among those discussed in class. Your program should still work correctly of another implementation is substituted for the one you chose.

## Running Program
In order to run with input files:

* javac proj2.java
* java proj1
* Enter a filename or Q to quit: small-input.txt
* Results will be in small-output.txt
